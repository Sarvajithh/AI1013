# AI1013
This is repository which contains the course work for the course AI1013- Programming for AI, taught by Karthik P.N in 2025 spring
As of April 23rd 2025, there were 4 aassigments in this course, which covers wide range of topics in AI and ML alike. 

*Assignment-1* 
  We were given a dataset and from which we are asked to analyse reaction rates of a neuron and another question which revolves under the firing rates of neurons.
  We performed linear regression on the average search delays, and the entropic distances
  For the later part of question we were asked to fit a gamma distribution for the avg search delays and print kolmogorov-Smirinov Static 

*Assignment-2*
  We were asked to train a simple feedforward neural network, which consists of two hidden layers( 2- weights), and sigmoid function as activation function. Gradient descent as
  an optimizer for the weights. After the training, I plotted the loss from the validation data
  
  The other half of the assignment is to do a k-NN classifcation on Abalone dataset. And find the optimal k using MSE loss.

*Assignment-3*
  ~We were asked to train a 2 hidden layer MLP(multi layer perceptron) for sinc {sinx/x} with normal noise.
  And the other half is a convoutional neural network to detect rock, paper, scissors using pytorch~

*Assignment-4*
  We were asked to classify two semicircle points using k means
  The latter part of the question is about K-means++ and its advantage against random initialization
