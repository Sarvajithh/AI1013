📘 Course Assignments
📝 Assignment 1: Neuronal Reaction & Firing Rate Analysis
Objective: Analyze a dataset to study neuronal reaction and firing rates.

Key Concepts:

Performed linear regression on average search delays and entropic distances.

Modeled average search delays using gamma distribution.

Evaluated goodness-of-fit using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic.

🧠 Assignment 2: Feedforward Neural Network & k-NN Classification
Part 1: Feedforward Neural Network

Implemented a neural network with two hidden layers using sigmoid activation.

Trained the model using gradient descent.

Visualized validation loss over training epochs.

Part 2: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Performed classification on the Abalone dataset.

Evaluated model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Determined the optimal value of k.

🔁 Assignment 3: Function Approximation & CNN Classification
Part 1: MLP for Sinc Function

Trained a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to approximate the sinc(x) = sin(x)/x function with added noise.

Part 2: CNN for Rock-Paper-Scissors

Built a Convolutional Neural Network using PyTorch.

Classified images into rock, paper, or scissors.

📊 Assignment 4: Clustering with K-Means
Part 1: Semicircle Classification

Applied k-means clustering to classify two semicircular datasets.

Part 2: K-Means++ Initialization

Explored the benefits of K-Means++ over random initialization.

Discussed improvements in convergence speed and accuracy.
